        The game can be played by 2 to 8 people.\n
        - Players make their moves in turns.\n
        - The order is determined at the very\n
        beginning of the game and corresponds\n
        to the order in which the player’s\n
        name is written when he is added\n
        to the game.\n
        - A player can come up with only one sentence.\n
        - The sentence is limited to 60 characters.\n
        - Any player can finish the game after\n
        each of the participants in the game\n
        has made at least 1 move.\n
        There are three levels of difficulty for the game:\n
        1. Easy. All previously composed sentences are visible\n
        to all participants in the game at any time.\n
        2. Medium. The player sees only the last sentence\n
        composed by the player before him.\n
        3. Hard. The player sees only the last sentence\n
        composed by the player before him.\n
        In his turn the player must use\n
        the randomly generated mandatory word.</string>
